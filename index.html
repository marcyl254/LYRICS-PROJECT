        <h3>Honeymoon Avenue</h3>
        <b>LYRICS</b>
        <p>
          [Intro: Ariana Grande & Leon Thomas III]<br />
          Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br />
          Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br />
          Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da<br />
          (Da, da) Uh-huh<br />
          (Da, da) Ooh, yeah<br />
          (Da, da) Mmm, ah<br />
          (Da, da) It's the Rascals<br /><br />
          [Verse 1]<br />
          I looked in my rearview mirror and<br />
          It seemed to make a lot more sense<br />
          Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah<br />
          Uh, I'm ready to make that turn<br />
          Before we both crash and burn<br />
          'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Verse 2]<br />
          Hey, what happened to the butterflies?<br />
          Guess they encountered that stop sign<br />
          And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light<br />
          Hey, right when I think that we found it (Found it)<br />
          Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)<br />
          You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"<br />
          But we're still goin' the wrong way<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Bridge]<br />
          They say only fools fall in love<br />
          Well, they must've been talkin' about us<br />
          And sometimes I feel like we've been here before<br />
          I could be wrong, but I know I'm right<br />
          We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight<br />
          Honey, I know, yeah<br />
          We can find our way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Outro]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in—<br />
          Traffic, I'm under<br />
          Pressure, pressure—<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Avenue<br />
          Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back

          Falls perfectly without her tryin'<br />
          She's so beautiful<br />
          And I tell her every day<br />
          Yeah, I know, I know<br />
          When I compliment her, she won't believe me<br />
          And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see<br />
          But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          When I see your face (Face, face)<br />

          Yeah<br /><br />
          [Verse 2]<br />
          Her lips,her lips<br />
          I could kiss them all day if she'd let me<br />
          Her laugh,her laugh<br />
          She hates,but I think it's so sexy<br />
          She's so beautiful,and I tell her every day<br />
          Oh, you know, you know, you know<br />
          I'd never ask you to change<br />
          If perfect's what you're searching for<br />
          Then just stay the same<br />
          So don't even bother askin' if you look okay<br />
          You know I'll say<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          When I see your face (Face, face)<br />

        <b>LYRICS</b>
        <p>
          [Verse 1]<br />
          I'm still a fan even though I was salty<br />
          Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy<br />
          Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br>
I'm so mature, I'm so mature<br>
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men<br>
I don't want none, I just want you<br>
If I can't have you, no one should<br><br>
[Chorus]<br>
I might<br>
I might kill my ex, not the best idea<br>
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?<br>
I might kill my ex, I still love him though<br>
Rather be in jail than alone<br><br>
