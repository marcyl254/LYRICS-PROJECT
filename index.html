        <h3>Honeymoon Avenue</h3>
        <b>LYRICS</b>
        <p>
          [Intro: Ariana Grande & Leon Thomas III]<br />
          Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br />
          Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br />
          Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da<br />
          (Da, da) Uh-huh<br />
          (Da, da) Ooh, yeah<br />
          (Da, da) Mmm, ah<br />
          (Da, da) It's the Rascals<br /><br />
          [Verse 1]<br />
          I looked in my rearview mirror and<br />
          It seemed to make a lot more sense<br />
          Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah<br />
          Uh, I'm ready to make that turn<br />
          Before we both crash and burn<br />
          'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Verse 2]<br />
          Hey, what happened to the butterflies?<br />
          Guess they encountered that stop sign<br />
          And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light<br />
          Hey, right when I think that we found it (Found it)<br />
          Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)<br />
          You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"<br />
          But we're still goin' the wrong way<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Bridge]<br />
          They say only fools fall in love<br />
          Well, they must've been talkin' about us<br />
          And sometimes I feel like we've been here before<br />
          I could be wrong, but I know I'm right<br />
          We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight<br />
          Honey, I know, yeah<br />
          We can find our way home<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br />
          I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br />
          Coastin' like crazy<br />
          Can we get back to the way it was?<br /><br />
          [Outro]<br />
          Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br />
          And you decided not to make a change<br />
          Stuck in the same old lane<br />
          Goin' the wrong way home<br />
          I feel like my heart is stuck in—<br />
          Traffic, I'm under<br />
          Pressure, pressure—<br />
          Let's just go back to the way it was<br />
          When we were on<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br />
          Avenue<br />
          Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back

          Her hair, her hair<br />
          Falls perfectly without her tryin'<br />
          She's so beautiful<br />
          And I tell her every day<br />
          Yeah, I know, I know<br />
          When I compliment her, she won't believe me<br />
          And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see<br />
          But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          When I see your face (Face, face)<br />

          Yeah<br /><br />
          [Verse 2]<br />
          Her lips,her lips<br />
          I could kiss them all day if she'd let me<br />
          Her laugh,her laugh<br />
          She hates,but I think it's so sexy<br />
          She's so beautiful,and I tell her every day<br />
          Oh, you know, you know, you know<br />
          I'd never ask you to change<br />
          If perfect's what you're searching for<br />
          Then just stay the same<br />
          So don't even bother askin' if you look okay<br />
          You know I'll say<br /><br />

          [Verse 1]<br />
          I'm still a fan even though I was salty<br />
          Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy<br />
          Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'<br /><br />
          [Pre-Chorus]<br />
          I'm so mature, I'm so mature<br />
          I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men<br />
          I don't want none, I just want you<br />
          If I can't have you, no one should<br /><br />
          [Chorus]<br />
          I might<br />
          I might kill my ex, not the best idea<br />
          His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?<br />
          I might kill my ex, I still love him though<br />
          Rather be in jail than alone<br /><br />
          [Verse 2]<br />
          I get the sense that it's a lost cause<br />
          I get the sense that you might really love her<br />
          This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence<br />
          I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but
          damn<br />
          You was out of reach<br />
          You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach<br />
          Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion<br />
          Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat<br /><br />

        <h2>Olivia Rodrigo -</h2>
        <h3>Driver's License</h3>
        <b>LYRICS</b>
        [Verse 1]<br />
        I got my driver's license last week<br />
        Just like we always talked about<br />
        'Cause you were so excited for me<br />
        To finally drive up to your house<br />
        But today, I drove through the suburbs<br />
        Crying 'cause you weren't around<br /><br />
        [Verse 2]<br />
        And you're probably with that blonde girl<br />
        Who always made me doubt<br />
        She's so much older than me<br />
        She's everything I'm insecure about<br />
        Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs<br />
        'Cause how could I ever love someone else?<br /><br />
        [Chorus]<br />
        And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no
        one<br />
        And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br />
        Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br />
        'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<br /><br />
        [Verse 3]<br />
        And all my friends are tired<br />
        Of hearing how much I miss you, but<br />
        I kinda feel sorry for them<br />
        'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do<br />
        Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs<br />
        And pictured I was driving home to you<br /><br />
        [Chorus]<br />
        And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no
        one<br />
        And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br />
        Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br />
        'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<br /><br />
        [Bridge]<br />
        Red lights, stop signs<br />
        I still see your face in the white cars, front yards<br />
        Can't drive past the places we used to go to<br />
        'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br />
        Sidewalks we crossed<br />
        I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing<br />
        Over all the noise<br />
        God, I'm so blue, know we're through<br />
        But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br /><br />
        [Chorus]<br />
        And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no
        one<br />
        And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br />
        Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br />
        'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<br /><br />
        [Outro]<br />
        Yeah,you said forever,now I drive alone past your street
