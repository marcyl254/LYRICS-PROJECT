      <h2>Ariana Grande -</h2>
      <h3>Honeymoon Avenue</h3>
      <b>LYRICS</b>
      <p>
        [Intro: Ariana Grande & Leon Thomas III]<br>
Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br>
Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da<br>
Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da<br>
(Da, da) Uh-huh<br>
(Da, da) Ooh, yeah<br>
(Da, da) Mmm, ah<br>
(Da, da) It's the Rascals<br><br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I looked in my rearview mirror and<br>
It seemed to make a lot more sense<br>
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah<br>
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn<br>
Before we both crash and burn<br>
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br>
And you decided not to make a change<br>
Stuck in the same old lane<br>
Goin' the wrong way home<br><br>
[Chorus]<br>
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br>
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br>
Let's just go back to the way it was<br>
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br>
Coastin' like crazy<br>
Can we get back to the way it was?<br><br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?<br>
Guess they encountered that stop sign<br>
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light<br>
Hey, right when I think that we found it (Found it)<br>
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)<br>
You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"<br>
But we're still goin' the wrong way<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br>
And you decided not to make a change<br>
Stuck in the same old lane<br>
Goin' the wrong way home<br><br>
[Chorus]<br>
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br>
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br>
Let's just go back to the way it was<br>
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br>
Coastin' like crazy<br>
Can we get back to the way it was?<br><br>
[Bridge]<br>
They say only fools fall in love<br>
Well, they must've been talkin' about us<br>
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before<br>
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right<br>
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight<br>
Honey, I know, yeah<br>
We can find our way home<br><br>
[Chorus]<br>
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic<br>
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want<br>
Let's just go back to the way it was<br>
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Honeymoon Avenue, baby<br>
Coastin' like crazy<br>
Can we get back to the way it was?<br><br>
[Outro]<br>
Baby, you know how to drive in rain<br>
And you decided not to make a change<br>
Stuck in the same old lane<br>
Goin' the wrong way home<br>
I feel like my heart is stuck in—<br>
Traffic, I'm under<br>
Pressure, pressure—<br>
Let's just go back to the way it was<br>
When we were on<br>
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Avenue<br>
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back
